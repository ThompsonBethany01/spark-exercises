# Distributed ML Overview

> Exercises Completed by Bethany Thompson in the Darden Codeup Cohort

## In this module, we will learn about Apache Spark, a tool for handling big, distributed, or streaming data.

1. Overview: In the overview we will present a rough outline of how spark works, and look at the components from a 10,000 ft view.
2. Enrionment Setup: In this lesson we will setup your envrionment so that you can run spark.
3. Spark API: In this lesson we will cover how to work with spark through python, and look at how to manipulate spark dataframes.
4. Data Wrangling: In this lesson we will cover reading and writing data with spark, and use our spark API knowledge to acquire and prepare a dataset.
5. Data Exploration: In this lesson we will cover various strategies and examples of data exploration for large, distributed data sets.
6. ML with Spark: In this lesson we will cover some techniques for implementing machine learning models on top of spark.
